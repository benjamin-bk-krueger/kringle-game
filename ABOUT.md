Today I took the decision I want to (re-)gain developer's skills (sadly my job is rather "managerial"). There are so many interesting technologies and tools out there you should know more about. So my plan is to build a project using all those technologies and tools and to learn at the same time. I don't know how much time I can invest here but to see my own progress I'm writing these notes at the same time.
My theme will be the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge (https://www.sans.org/mlp/holiday-hack-challenge/). My goal is to create some console-based adventure game like the gold old LucasArts games in the 90s. It should mimic the original game and offer a walkthrough for the original game's quests at the same time.
